            <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the most widely used language to write Web Pages.<br />
            <ul>
                <li>Hypertext refers to the way in which Web pages (HTML documents) are linked together. Thus, the link available on a webpage is called Hypertext.</li>
                <li>As its name suggests, HTML is a Markup Language which means you use HTML to simply "mark-up" a text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure it to display.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents like headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information between researchers.</p>
            <p>Now, HTML is being widely used to format web pages with the help of different tags available in HTML language.</p>

                <li>
                Create Stunning Web site - CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background images or colors are used, layout designs,variations in display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other effects.
                </li>
                <li>
                Become a web designer - If you want to start a carrer as a professional web designer, HTML and CSS designing is a must skill.

                <li>
                Control web - CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document. Most commonly, CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML or XHTML.
                </li>
                <li>
                Learn other languages - Once you understands the basic of HTML and CSS then other related technologies like javascript, php, or angular are become easier to understand.

            <li>JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by several websites for scripting the webpages.</li>
            <li>It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document.</li>
            <li>It was introduced in the year 1995 for adding programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigator browser. Since then, it has been adopted by all other graphical web browsers.</li>
            <li>With JavaScript, users can build modern web applications to interact directly without reloading the page every time.</li> 
            <li>The traditional website uses js to provide several forms of interactivity and simplicity.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Although, JavaScript has no connectivity with Java programming language. The name was suggested and provided in the times when Java was gaining popularity in the market. In addition to web browsers, databases such as CouchDB and MongoDB uses JavaScript as their scripting and query language.</p>

            <p>SQL databases are considered relational databases.</p>
            <p>They store related data in separate tables.</p>
            <p>When data is needed, it is queried from multiple tables to join the data back together.</p>
            <p>MongoDB is a document database which is often referred to as a non-relational database.</p>
            <p>This does not mean that relational data cannot be stored in document databases.</p>
            <p>It means that relational data is stored differently.</p>
            <p>A better way to refer to it is as a non-tabular database.</p>
            <p>MongoDB stores data in flexible documents. Instead of having multiple tables you can simply keep all of your related data together.</p>
            <p>This makes reading your data very fast.</p>
            <p>You can still have multiple groups of data too. In MongoDB, instead of tables these are called collections.</p>

            <p>In computer science, a data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer program so that it can be accessed and used efficiently.</p>
            <p>Data structures provide a means of managing large amounts of data, enabling efficient searching, sorting, insertion, and deletion of data.</p>
            <p>Data structures can be categorized into two types: primitive data structures and non-primitive data structures.</p>
            <p>Primitive data structures are the most basic data structures available in a programming language, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and booleans.</p>
            <p>Non-primitive data structures are complex data structures that are built using primitive data types, such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables.</p>
            <p>The choice of data structure for a particular task depends on the type and amount of data to be processed, the operations that need to be performed on the data, and the efficiency requirements of the program.</p>
            <p>Efficient use of data structures can greatly improve the performance of a program, making it faster and more memory-efficient. A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.</p>
            <p>The idea is to reduce the space and time complexities of different tasks.</p>
            <p>The choice of a good data structure makes it possible to perform a variety of critical operations effectively.</p>
            <p>An efficient data structure also uses minimum memory space and execution time to process the structure.</p>
            <h4>Data structures are an essential concept in computer science and programming.</h4>
            <ul>
            <li>Here are some reasons why they are important:</li>
            <li><h3>Efficient data processing:</h3> Data structures provide a way to organize and store data in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, manipulation, and storage of data. For example, using a hash table to store data can provide constant-time access to data.</li>
            <li><h3>Memory management:</h3> Proper use of data structures can help to reduce memory usage and optimize the use of resources. For example, using dynamic arrays can allow for more efficient use of memory than using static arrays.</li>
            <li><h3>Code reusability:</h3> Data structures can be used as building blocks in various algorithms and programs, making it easier to reuse code.</li>
            <li><h3>Abstraction:</h3> Data structures provide a level of abstraction that allows programmers to focus on the logical structure of the data and the operations that can be performed on it, rather than on the details of how the data is stored and manipulated.</li>
            <li><h3>Algorithm design:</h3> Many algorithms rely on specific data structures to operate efficiently. Understanding data structures is crucial for designing and implementing efficient algorithms.</li>

            <p>It is a sport where coding skills are tested based on the problem-solving capability of a person. 
            The better the problem solving, the better competitive programmer will be. There are different methods to solve a given situation but solving it efficiently is a good sign of a coder. 
            During competitive programming, a person does mind exercises in thinking analytically, logically and solve a given set of questions.</p>
            <p>After understanding the basic idea of competitive programming, let us know why should it be learned and the reason for its popularity:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><h3>Growth in Career:</h3> Competitive programming makes you a perfect eligible candidate at big product-based companies like amazon, google, Microsoft, etc., because big product-based companies demand excellent problem-solving skills. Coding can shape your career. The persons with good problem-solving skills bag a fantastic offer and thus get placed.
            Furthermore, if the student is from a tier 3 college or university, can get referrals from employees if the coding skills are good.</li>
            <li><h4>Win coding competitions:</h4> There are several famous coding competitions like google hashcode, codejam, ACM ICPC, where students participate and get assured prizes. In addition to that, if a person secures a good rank in those competitions, there are high chances to get interview calls from product-based companies. For example, google hashcode's excellent score holder is interviewed by google for a software engineer's role.</li>
            <li><h4>Learn teamwork and promote networking:</h4> When participating in competitive coding hackathons, there is generally a team of 3 to 10 members. So, being in a group, a person can learn teamwork to work under pressure calmly. It boosts our networking, too, as we socialize with the mentors, the panel, etc., which acts as a booster in our career.</li>
            <li><h4>Learn to stay calm and focused:</h4> Competitive programming is not to be learned in some days or weeks. It takes years or months to become a well-ranked coder. This, in turn, demands a lot of patience as it can be stressful sometimes. Usually, people give up in between when they are not able to solve problems. The bright side is it teaches us how to rise from our failures.</li>
            <li><h4>Active community:</h4> The family of competitive programming is so vast that one can be flooded with numerous tutorials, doubt sessions, etc. Many free resources are available on YouTube and some websites where a beginner can learn and follow up to an advanced level. There are various websites to test your skills like CodeChef, codeforces, leetcode, atcoder, etc.</li>
            <li><h4>Long-term future security:</h4> With the rise of this computer and technologies era, coding will take a hike in the coming years. So the problem-solving capabilities won't go to waste in the coming future. Instead, it will boost our careers and will provide security.</li>

            <p>Deep learning is based on the branch of machine learning, which is a subset of artificial intelligence. Since neural networks imitate the human brain and so deep learning will do. In deep learning, nothing is programmed explicitly. Basically, it is a machine learning class that makes use of numerous nonlinear processing units so as to perform feature extraction as well as transformation. The output from each preceding layer is taken as input by each one of the successive layers.</p>
            <p>Deep learning models are capable enough to focus on the accurate features themselves by requiring a little guidance from the programmer and are very helpful in solving out the problem of dimensionality. Deep learning algorithms are used, especially when we have a huge no of inputs and outputs.</p>
            <p>Since deep learning has been evolved by the machine learning, which itself is a subset of artificial intelligence and as the idea behind the artificial intelligence is to mimic the human behavior, so same is "the idea of deep learning to build such algorithm that can mimic the brain".</p>
            <p>Deep learning is implemented with the help of Neural Networks, and the idea behind the motivation of Neural Network is the biological neurons, which is nothing but a brain cell.</p>
           <p>A feed-forward neural network is none other than an Artificial Neural Network, which ensures that the nodes do not form a cycle. In this kind of neural network, all the perceptrons are organized within layers, such that the input layer takes the input, and the output layer generates the output. Since the hidden layers do not link with the outside world, it is named as hidden layers. 
            Each of the perceptrons contained in one single layer is associated with each node in the subsequent layer. It can be concluded that all of the nodes are fully connected. It does not contain any visible or invisible connection between the nodes in the same layer. There are no back-loops in the feed-forward network. To minimize the prediction error, the backpropagation algorithm can be used to update the weight values.</p>
